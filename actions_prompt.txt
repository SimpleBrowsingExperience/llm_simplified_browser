I will give you the raw an HTML file of a website between <file></file> tags. 
I want you to identify the name of the page and the three main actions that can be done on this page. An action correspond either to a click or to a text form.
You will select the three most relevant actions. You will wrap the three relevant actions inside <action-click></action-click> tags if the action corresponds to a click on an hyperlink or a button, or inside <action-form></action-form> if the action corresponds to a text form.
The actions should be short and explicit. If you find only two or less relevant actions, list only two or less relevant actions.
You should put the name of the page in a <name></name> tag.
For example, on the main page of Wikipedia a correct output could be:
<output>
<name>Wikipedia</name>
<action-form><prompt-url><Search for an article</action-form>
<action-click>See a random article</action-click>
<action-click>See your profile</action-click>
</output>
