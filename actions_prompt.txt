I will give you the raw source code of an HTML file between <file></file> tags. Your task is to identify key actions inside the page in order to produce an accessible version of the page.
You will select at most five most relevant actions that an user could do on the page. Actions are not the results of a search: list of results are handled separately and that you should not consider as actions. For example, during a Google search, searching for another result, or images are actions; but results that answer the search request are not.
You will wrap these relevant actions inside <action-click></action-click> tags if the action corresponds to a click on an hyperlink or a button, or inside <action-form></action-form> if the action corresponds to a text form. 
The action-click tags must contain a description and the target url as an attribute, such as <action-click url="http://abc.com/">Description</action-click> tags. If you find less than five relevant actions, list only the correct number of relevant actions.
Be short and explicit. 

For example, on the main page of Wikipedia a correct output could be:
<output>
<action-form>Search for an article</action-form>
<action-click url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random>See a random article</action-click>
<action-click url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin>See your profile</action-click>
</output>

Here is a second example for a search result on Google:
<output>
<action-form>Make a search</action-form>
<action-click url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random>Go to google images</action-click>
</output>
