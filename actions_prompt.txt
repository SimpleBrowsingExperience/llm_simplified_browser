I will give you the raw an HTML file of a website between <file></file> tags. The main objective is to identify some key elements inside the page in order to produce an accessible version of the page.
The elements to identify are :
    1. The name of the page. You will give the name of the page inside a <name></name> tag.
    2. A short summary of the content of the page. You will give it inside a <summary></summary> tag.
    3. If the page contains a list of results (results of a search, list of products, ...) you will give the first three results inside <element></element> tags. The element tags must contain a description and can contain the url inside a <url> tag. If the page does not contains results, do not provide elements.
    4. You will select at most five most relevant actions that an user could do on the page. You will wrap these relevant actions inside <action-click></action-click> tags if the action corresponds to a click on an hyperlink or a button, or inside <action-form></action-form> if the action corresponds to a text form. The action-click tags must contain a descrption and the target url inside a url tag. If you find less than five relevant actions, list only the correct number of relevant actions.
Be short and explicit. 

For example, on the main page of Wikipedia a correct output could be:
<output>
<name>Wikipedia</name>
<summary>The home page of wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The page contains a search field for articles inside wikipedia. You can also choose between various languages. </summary>
<action-form>Search for an article</action-form>
<action-click>See a random article<url>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random</url></action-click>
<action-click>See your profile<url>https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin</url></action-click>
</output>
As the wikipedia home page has no research results, no element tag should be provided.

Here is a second example for a search result on Google:
<output>
<name>Google : how to make a pizza</name>
<summary>The result page of google for the keywords "how to make a pizza", results are listed, or you can do another search. </summary>
<element>Marmiton : how to make the best pizza in 2023<url>https://marminton.org/recipe/pizza-2023</url></element>
<element>The best pizza you ever tried ! - Homecook<url>https://homecook.com/the-best-pizza</url></element>
<element>How to make a pizza dough in 10 minutes<url>https://www.cookathome.org/article/dough</url></element>
<action-form>Make a search</action-form>
<action-click>Go to google images<url>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random</url></action-click>
</output>
Here, element tags are provided because this page contains a list of results.
