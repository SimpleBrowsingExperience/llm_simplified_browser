differentiate between because their shape is so similar. Still, our panelists all liked the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33087/186946/4/133293/?merchant=Amazon">J+S Classic Aviator</a> sunglasses—during testing they were deemed universally comfortable, and they protect against UV. We’ve worn them for the past couple of years, and their metal build has proved to be well made and sturdy. They come with a one-year warranty.</p></div></div><div><div><p>We were impressed by how comfortably the J+S Classic Aviator pair fit our testers. Three Wirecutter staffers with very differently shaped heads all agreed that these aviators were the most comfortable they tried. These sunglasses are lightweight, they provide lots of coverage, and as with most of the aviators we tested, the nose pads are adjustable, so the glasses can better fit your face. The only aviators our panelists liked more than the J+S Classic Aviator pair were the <a href="#a-premium-pair-kent-wang-sunglasses-aviator">Kent Wang sunglasses</a>, and which cost nearly three times as much.</p></div></div><div><div><div><article><div><aside><div><div><div><img/></div><div>The J+S Classic Aviator sunglasses fit most of our panel testers’ faces well, and we appreciated the coverage from their large lenses.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></div></div></div><div><div><div><img/></div><div>The J+S Classic Aviator sunglasses fit most of our panel testers’ faces well, and we appreciated the coverage from their large lenses.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></div></div></div><div><div><div><img/></div><div>The J+S Classic Aviator sunglasses fit most of our panel testers’ faces well, and we appreciated the coverage from their large lenses.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></div></div></div><div><div><div><img/></div><div>The J+S Classic Aviator sunglasses fit most of our panel testers’ faces well, and we appreciated the coverage from their large lenses.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></div></div></div></aside></div></article><div><div><figcaption>The J+S Classic Aviator sunglasses fit most of our panel testers’ faces well, and we appreciated the coverage from their large lenses.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></figcaption></div><div><div><button><div><div><img/></div></div></button><button><div><div><img/></div></div></button><button><div><div><img/></div></div></button><button><div><div><img/></div></div></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><p>The J+S sunglasses have a sturdy metal build, and their spring hinges produce a satisfying click when you open and close the arms.

Yet these sunglasses also stand out from the other aviators we tested, thanks to their smaller, more rectangular steel frames and their high quality.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Note: This style is available in 54 mm (standard) and 57 mm (large) lenses. Previously these aviators were available in just standard size.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Two staff Wirecutter staffers noted that the Kent Wang aviators had a more defined shape than other aviators, as well as a more compact frame—they’re just 130 mm in total width. But even with this smaller size, they weren’t tight around the temple or the ears. One of our testers, who is Asian, found the Kent Wang pair especially good-looking and comfortable on her low-bridge nose.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Kent Wang pair’s steel frame feels noticeably sturdy compared with the “metallic alloy” of the cheaper J+S Classic Aviator pair—the Kent Wang sunglasses have been strong and resilient over the multiple years we’ve worn them.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Kent Wang offers three frame colors to choose from—gold, gunmetal, and silver—and the lenses on each are the same dark shade. The colors are classic but not as exciting as the wackier variety of color options available for our J+S aviators pick.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In 2021, Kent Wang increased its return-period policy to 60 days (up from 30 days) and added a two-year warranty. These improvements bumped the glasses from a good purchase to a great one.

In fact, many testers noted that the metal arms felt strong and resilient. Social video manager Katie Quinn told us that she accidentally stepped on her pair, and they were completely unscathed. Sungait provides a mini screwdriver with purchase, too, in case you need to adjust the hinges; it’s a welcome surprise for a pair of sunglasses that costs less than $20.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Sungait sunglasses look and feel classic: They’re logo-free and unisex; for a timeless combo, we recommend buying them in black with gray lenses. If you want a punchier look, over 20 color combinations are available at this writing. In addition to the mini screwdriver, the Sungaits come with a bag and a cloth for cleaning your lenses.</p></div></div><div><div><p>These have a lifetime warranty, which is a great perk for a pair of sub-$20 sunglasses.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Flaws but not dealbreakers: </strong>During testing, we had no complaints about the Sungait Vintage Round Sunglasses.

If you want to buy “nice” sunglasses but can’t spend $300, this brand offers high-quality frames for a fraction of the price of most designer sunglasses. For just over 50 bucks, the Keyhole glasses offer a distinctive, stylish look and the same UV protection as on the Sungait glasses. We’ve been recommending this pair since late 2017, and we haven’t had a single issue with them.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Whereas the <a href="#our-favorite-round-pair-sungait-vintage-round-sunglasses">Sungait round sunglasses</a> have plastic frames with metal arms, these Kent Wang sunglasses are made from cellulose acetate, which is more lightweight and flexible than basic plastic frames. Despite being bulkier than the Sungait pair, the Kent Wang sunglasses weigh about the same. The Keyhole glasses come in various shades of vibrant acetate or horn (though the latter costs $95 more), and both versions are distinct and striking. For our testers, the glasses have garnered compliments from friends and acquaintances, as well as “Where are those from?” questions, for years. The frame has no external branding, but it does have a small, gold-foil Kent Wang logo on the inside of the left arm; the logo is tasteful and attractive, and it’s impossible to see while the sunglasses are on your face.</p></div></div><div><div><div><article><div><aside><div><div><div><img/></div><div>The Kent Wang Keyhole sunglasses looked great on everyone who wore them, and they garnered comments from testers on how comfortable they were.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></div></div></div><div><div><div><img/></div><div>The Kent Wang Keyhole sunglasses looked great on everyone who wore them, and they garnered comments from testers on how comfortable they were.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></div></div></div><div><div><div><img/></div><div>The Kent Wang Keyhole sunglasses looked great on everyone who wore them, and they garnered comments from testers on how comfortable they were.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></div></div></div><div><div><div><img/></div><div>The Kent Wang Keyhole sunglasses looked great on everyone who wore them, and they garnered comments from testers on how comfortable they were.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></div></div></div></aside></div></article><div><div><figcaption>The Kent Wang Keyhole sunglasses looked great on everyone who wore them, and they garnered comments from testers on how comfortable they were.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></figcaption></div><div><div><button><div><div><img/></div></div></button><button><div><div><img/></div></div></button><button><div><div><img/></div></div></button><button><div><div><img/></div></div></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><p>All of our panelists found the Kent Wang Keyhole sunglasses comfortable, and they were the ones I kept reaching for even after testing finished.

The spring hinges on the Keyhole sunglasses allow a wider range of movement in the arms than the screw-bolt hinges on the cheaper Sungait pair (or any other round sunglasses we tested, all of which weren’t as flexible). And the Keyhole pair’s lightweight acetate body made these sunglasses easy to wear for even longer periods of time, too.</p></div></div><div><div><p>I’ve been wearing them for years, and I haven’t noticed any scratches or signs of wear (though we have babied them a little due to their price).</p></div></div><div><div><p>These sunglasses don’t come with a storage pouch, but you can pay an additional $3 for a microfiber pouch or $5 for a hard case—and if you want to return them, you have an above-average 60 days.

They also offer a perk unlike anything we’ve seen from other sunglasses we recommend: Sunski <a href="https://sunski.com/pages/about">uses recycled plastic</a>, which is a nice step toward being slightly more eco-friendly.</p></div></div><div><div><div><article><div><aside><div><div><div><img/></div><div>We may not all look like Audrey Hepburn in “Breakfast at Tiffany’s," but with the Sunski Camina sunglasses, we’re most of the way there.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></div></div></div><div><div><div><img/></div><div>We may not all look like Audrey Hepburn in “Breakfast at Tiffany’s," but with the Sunski Camina sunglasses, we’re most of the way there.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></div></div></div><div><div><div><img/></div><div>We may not all look like Audrey Hepburn in “Breakfast at Tiffany’s," but with the Sunski Camina sunglasses, we’re most of the way there.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></div></div></div><div><div><div><img/></div><div>We may not all look like Audrey Hepburn in “Breakfast at Tiffany’s," but with the Sunski Camina sunglasses, we’re most of the way there.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></div></div></div></aside></div></article><div><div><figcaption>We may not all look like Audrey Hepburn in “Breakfast at Tiffany’s," but with the Sunski Camina sunglasses, we’re most of the way there.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></figcaption></div><div><div><button><div><div><img/></div></div></button><button><div><div><img/></div></div></button><button><div><div><img/></div></div></button><button><div><div><img/></div></div></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><p>The sunglasses measure 139 mm wide in total; each lens is approximately 53 mm. “I like how big these frames are; they cover the space above and below my eyes, so I don’t have to worry about revealing the bags under them,” my mother said with a laugh while wearing the Caminas. “They’re unusually shaped in how deep and wide they are, but I like them.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Caminas come with a storage pouch, a sticker, and a lens-care booklet. As with most other sunglasses we recommend, the package supplies neither a case nor a cleaning cloth. Sunski covers the frames with a 30-day return policy and a lifetime warranty, though.</p></div></div><div><div><p>If you want to buy something more eye-catching than a classic black frame, the Camina sunglasses also come in pink, translucent brown, and tortoise.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Flaws but not dealbreakers:</strong> The Sunski Camina sunglasses cost around $60, but we think the price is justified by their expansive <a href="https://sunski.com/pages/sunglasses-lifetime-warranty">lifetime warranty</a>, which covers broken frames. If you encounter any manufacturer defects, or if the sunglasses break under normal use, Sunski will repair or replace them for you.</p></div></div><div><div><p>However, their lifetime warranty does not apply to scratched or damaged lenses. Lenses can be replaced through their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/56650/192001/4/165077/?merchant=Sunski">Lens Replacement Program</a>, for $18 per kit.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Frame width:</strong> one size (139 mm)<br/><strong>UV-protected:</strong> yes<br/><strong>Polarized: </strong>yes<br/><strong>Warranty: </strong>lifetime<br/><strong>Return policy:</strong> within 30 days</p></div></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><h2>A more subtle cat-eye pair: EyeBuyDirect Cartel</h2></div></div><div><div><div><div><figure><div><img/></div><figcaption> <!-- --> <span>Photo: Michael Murtaugh</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><div><h4>Our pick</h4><div><span><div><div><span></span></div></div></span><div><div><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33092/154518/4/133278?merchant=Eyebuydirect"><div><img/></div></a></div><div><h3><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33092/154518/4/133278?merchant=Eyebuydirect">Eyebuydirect Cartel</a></h3><h2><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33092/154518/4/133278?merchant=Eyebuydirect">Modern, restrained cat-eye shades</a></h2><p>If you have a petite face—or you don’t want sunglasses to dominate your look—these restrained cat-eye shades are just right.

Wirecutter senior editor Marguerite Preston and staff writer Dorie Chevlen both said The OGs were the most comfortable Wayfarer-style sunglasses they tried.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Some of our panelists said The OGs felt well made for their price, with sturdy, solid hinges that easily opened and closed. We had no issues with their understated design, although there is a small “goodr” logo written in white on the sides of the arms. Dorie added that the very dark look is classic and goes with just about anything. We’ve worn Goodr’s The OGs since we first made this recommendation multiple years ago, and they’ve held up well.</p></div></div><div><div><p>All of the frames Goodr sells as “The OGs” are Wayfarer-style glasses, just in different <a href="https://goodr.com/collections/all-models/the-ogs">frame and lens color combinations</a>, and all should be equally good. The OGs come in a pouch that doubles as a microfiber cleaning cloth.</p></div></div><div><div><p>If you have difficulty finding sunglasses that are big enough, Goodr sells a variant of The OGs called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33117/154545/4/95437/?merchant=Goodr">BFGs</a>. Per Goodr, these glasses have “wider frames, longer arms, and bigger lenses than our OGs,” with an overall frame width of 146 mm and a temple length of 155 mm, notably longer than anything else we looked at. Although we didn’t test this version of The OGs, we still think it would be worth considering for someone who has a larger head and is looking for a Wayfarer-style pair.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Flaws but not dealbreakers: </strong>Goodr has a short return window and a dreadful naming scheme—the matte black colorway, for example, is called “A Ginger’s Soul.”</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Frame width:</strong> one size (139 mm)<br/><strong>UV-protected:</strong> yes<br/><strong>Polarized: </strong>yes<br/><strong>Warranty: </strong>one year<br/><strong>Return policy:</strong> within 30 days</p></div></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><h2>A colorful and fun Wayfarer-style pair: Blenders Sydney</h2></div></div><div><div><div><div><figure><div><img/></div><figcaption> <!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><div><h4>Our pick</h4><div><span><div><div><span></span></div></div></span><div><div><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/45985/173185/4/133280?merchant=Blenders"><div><img/></div></a></div><div><h3><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/45985/173185/4/133280?merchant=Blenders">Blenders Sydney</a></h3><h2><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/45985/173185/4/133280?merchant=Blenders">Bolder Wayfarer-style sunglasses</a></h2><p>Though these stylish sunglasses are more expensive than other Wayfarer-style glasses we like, they stand out due to their vibrant colors, interesting squarish shape, and premium look and feel.</p><div><h4>Buying Options</h4><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/45985/173185/4/133280?merchant=Blenders"><span>$49</span>*<!-- --> from <span>Blenders</span></a></div><p>*At the time of publishing, the price was <!-- -->$50<!-- -->.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Why they’re great: </strong>As soon as I saw the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/45985/173185/4/133297/?merchant=Blenders">Blenders Sydney</a> sunglasses, I felt a twinge of excitement at their vibrant frames. Their honey-colored arms and light-brown polarized lenses looked optimistic. Blenders’s line of sunglasses includes seven bright frame-and-lens combinations—a deep honey, a light amber, a transparent frame with highlighter-yellow lenses—that are sure to lift spirits. (The line also offers one pair of black frames, if your spirits are fine where they are.)</p></div></div><div><div><p>These sunglasses also stand out from other Wayfarer-style pairs we’ve tested thanks to their unusually tall lenses and keyhole nose bridge, both of which look distinctive and great. Unlike our other Wayfarer-style pick, <a href="#iconic-wayfarer-style-sunglasses-goodr-the-ogs">Goodr’s The OGs</a>, these Blenders sunglasses have no aggressive branding, and their construction feels notably more luxurious than that of the cheaper Wayfarer-style pairs we’ve tried.</p></div></div><div><div><div><article><div><aside><div><div><div><img/></div><div>The Blenders Sydney pair stands out from legions of other Wayfarer-inspired sunglasses.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></div></div></div><div><div><div><img/></div><div>The Blenders Sydney pair stands out from legions of other Wayfarer-inspired sunglasses.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></div></div></div><div><div><div><img/></div><div>The Blenders Sydney pair stands out from legions of other Wayfarer-inspired sunglasses.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></div></div></div><div><div><div><img/></div><div>The Blenders Sydney pair stands out from legions of other Wayfarer-inspired sunglasses.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></div></div></div></aside></div></article><div><div><figcaption>The Blenders Sydney pair stands out from legions of other Wayfarer-inspired sunglasses.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></figcaption></div><div><div><button><div><div><img/></div></div></button><button><div><div><img/></div></div></button><button><div><div><img/></div></div></button><button><div><div><img/></div></div></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><p>Beyond their striking colors, the Sydney sunglasses’s interesting design sets them apart. Their lenses and frames are more square-shaped and angular than the soft round edges of the cheaper Goodr The OGs. And unlike most other Wayfarer-style sunglasses, they have a keyhole nose bridge, which helps make them look visually lighter and less overwhelming on the face.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Sydney’s translucent frames show off their internal structure—you can see the wires running through the arms—which is a cool touch. We also appreciate the design’s minimal branding: two, white slanted stripes on their arms that are easy to miss unless you’re looking for them.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Looks aside, these sunglasses feel high-quality, lightweight, and comfortable. They’re made of a polycarbonate frame (with triacetate cellulose lenses) that feels stronger and better constructed than the simple plastic you often see on cheap sunglasses. For example, the Sydney’s arms open and close smoothly, while those of the cheaper competition feel stiff and mechanical.</p></div></div><div><div><p>These sunglasses come with a microfiber pouch; we would’ve preferred a hard case, but it’s better than nothing.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Flaws but not dealbreakers: </strong>Although Blenders has a pretty good, 45-day <a href="https://blenderseyewear.returnly.com/">return policy</a> and a one-year warranty, that’s less protection than some of our other picks can offer.</p></div></div><div><div><p>A final note because I’m finicky: The Sydney sunglasses don’t sit perfectly flat on a table when they’re folded.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Frame width:</strong> one size (142 mm)<br/><strong>UV-protected:</strong> yes<br/><strong>Polarized:</strong> yes<br/><strong>Warranty:</strong> one year<br/><strong>Return policy:</strong> within 45 days</p></div></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><h2>Our favorite prescription sunglasses</h2></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><article><div><aside><div><div><div><img/></div><div> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></div></div></div><div><div><div><img/></div><div> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></div></div></div></aside></div></article><div><div><figcaption> <span>Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></figcaption></div><div><div><button><div><div><img/></div></div></button><button><div><div><img/></div></div></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h4>Our pick</h4><div><span><div><div><span></span></div></div></span><div><div><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/45980/173180/4/133334?merchant=Eyebuydirect"><div><img/></div></a></div><div><h3><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/45980/173180/4/133334?merchant=Eyebuydirect">Eyebuydirect Taylor</a></h3><h2><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/45980/173180/4/133334?merchant=Eyebuydirect">Round prescription sunglasses</a></h2><p>These sunglasses are perfectly comfortable and look good on just about every face.

Goel, MD</a>, a clinical instructor at the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia and spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology; <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/suzann-pershing">Suzann Pershing, MD</a>, an associate professor of ophthalmology at Stanford University School of Medicine, who also serves as chief of ophthalmology for the VA Palo Alto Health Care System; and <a href="https://bascompalmer-doctors.umiamihealth.org/provider/Ellen+Koo/525028">Ellen Koo, MD</a>, an ophthalmologist and faculty member of the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute of the University of Miami who specializes in corneal and external diseases and LASIK.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><h2>About UV protection</h2></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>Ultraviolet rays are short rays (or <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight">wavelengths</a>) of light that aren’t visible to the human eye. “There are three types of UV rays: UVA, UVB, and UVC,” Pershing told us. Goel explained that although UVA rays accounted for about 95% of UV radiation, UVB rays were more likely to penetrate your eyes on an overcast day, at higher altitudes, or near highly reflective surfaces such as snow and ice. <a href="http://www.who.int/uv/faq/whatisuv/en/index2.html">The atmosphere filters out UVC rays</a>, so people don’t have to worry about those.</p></div></div><div><div><aside><p>The level of UV radiation entering the eye in the early morning and the late afternoon was nearly double that at midday.</p></aside></div></div><div><div><p>It’s important to protect against UV rays because they can cause and accelerate “many eye diseases associated with aging, including cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, and solar damage to the eye surface,” Pershing said. “You’re also at risk for eye cancer and more immediate structural damage to the retina at the back of the eye.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Although it sounds counterintuitive, Goel told us that the level of UV radiation entering the eye in the early morning (between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.) and the late afternoon (2 p.m. to 4 p.m.) was nearly double that at midday. He also told us that UV rays generally increased between the months of April and October throughout the continental United States, although the overall level of solar radiation depends on your location.</p></div></div><div><div><p>If you want to check how strong the solar radiation is in your particular area at any given time, you can consult online resources such as <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/us/state-college-pa/16801/sun-sand-weather/335315#">AccuWeather’s UV Index Forecast</a>. The site provides a rating for your area from 0 to 10; the higher the number, the more dangerous the sun’s UV emissions are, and the more precautions you should take to protect your eyes.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><h2>How we picked</h2></div></div><div><div><div><div><figure><div><img/></div><figcaption> We found 22 pairs of sunglasses—across four styles of frames—to test in 2020.<!-- --> <span>Photo: Michael Murtaugh</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>This guide focuses on affordable sunglasses with full UV protection and polarization for people who need a protective, comfortable pair of shades.</p></div></div><div><div><p>We initially researched more than 142 lost-cost pairs of sunglasses, considering the following:</p></div></div><div><div><ul><li><strong>UV protection: </strong>As Ravi D. Goel, MD, told us, when you use lenses without UV protection, you end up allowing more damaging UV rays to enter your eyes than if you were wearing no sunglasses at all, and you leave your eyes vulnerable to a slew of nasty ailments (more on that in the <a href="#about-uv-protection">UV protection</a> section). When you shop for sunglasses, always make sure to choose lenses with 99% or 100% UV protection or UV400 labeling (“UV400” means that the glasses block all light rays with wavelengths shorter than 400 nanometers, which is the cutoff for UV light).</li><li><strong>Value: </strong>After speaking to people who tended to break or lose their sunglasses, we decided that a good pair of cheap sunglasses should meet all our other criteria for less than $30. Some people are willing to take good care of their shades and pay more for style, excellent build quality, or other bonuses, so we also tested some higher-quality pairs, and for those we set our price cap at $70.</li><li><strong>Comfort: </strong>Although comfort is hard to evaluate because people’s faces and tolerance for glasses vary widely, we sought frames that were lightweight and pleasant to wear for long periods of time on a variety of face shapes and sizes.</li><li><strong>Build quality: </strong>Even cheap sunglasses should feel solidly constructed and be able to withstand your throwing them into a backpack or onto the backseat of a car. In our testing, we found that full-metal hinges helped—the hinges made arms easier to fold and unfold—but we considered models that had plastic hinges, too.</li><li><strong>Design: </strong>We looked for pairs in a range of styles, to suit different tastes. Models that offered a variety of color combinations to suit more people’s preferences were great, but we didn’t eliminate glasses that lacked such options. If you’re trying to decide what frames might fit your face, check the inside arm of a pair you already like. If you see <a href="https://www.allaboutvision.com/eyeglasses/faq/eyeglass-frame-size.htm">three numbers</a> there, the first number is the horizontal width of the lens in millimeters. In general, we prefer minimal company branding and logos.</li><li><strong>Lenses:</strong> Lens color is primarily a matter of style and preference. But as Ellen Koo, MD, told us, “Different color tints can serve different types of advantages. Gray-tinted lenses offer better overall protection and help reduce glare, especially off water and pavement surfaces. Amber or brown lenses improve contrast and enhance depth perception. Green lenses transmit all color evenly, meaning color perception is even. These also offer good contrast in dim or low-light conditions.”</li><li><strong>Polarization:</strong> All of our picks are polarized, or have the option to add polarization, since polarized lenses eliminate glare and increase contrast, and thus decrease eyestrain. Since it’s so much nicer to look through polarized lenses, and they’re available on some sunglasses that are as cheap as non-polarized options, there’s no reason to skip this feature. You may <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/128954-help-the-sun-is-shining-why-can-t-i-see-my-smartphone-screen">have trouble looking at certain LCD screens</a> through polarized lenses, however.</li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><h2>How we tested</h2></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>In 2019, I judged 37 pairs of sunglasses over the course of a week, walking around Manhattan, reading outside coffee shops, and taking the subway. During my first round of testing, I was able to cut the list of contenders by a third, to 25 pairs. To ensure that we evaluated the fit and look of these sunglasses on a wide variety of faces, I then tested those 25 pairs with a panel of 13 people across gender and race at The New York Times building.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In 2020, I tested 22 pairs of sunglasses across four categories over a month. During walks in Brooklyn, I was able to test each pair’s comfort and design. I also tested their durability and scratch resistance by throwing them into my backpack as I headed on biweekly excursions to the grocery store and to say hi to friends. After I completed these preliminary tests, I collected opinions virtually by sharing photos and videos of myself wearing the prospective picks, as well as in person.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In 2021, I tested another seven pairs of sunglasses with the assistance of staff writer Dorie Chevlen.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The main reason polarized lenses are so much better than non-polarized versions is that they reduce glare—if you were to compare the two types of lenses side by side, you’d never go with non-polarized lenses again. We tested the polarization of the sunglasses by lining up two pairs of each model of sunglasses, turning one gradually at a 90-degree angle to the other, and seeing whether the overlapped portion of the lenses became opaque.</p></div></div><div><div><p>That test works because polarization limits the amount of light coming in horizontally while still letting light through vertically, and therefore two of the same lenses stacked at 90-degree angles should block out all light. You can view just how we did it—and how to try this test yourself with your own sunglasses—in the animation below.</p></div></div><div><div><figure><div></div><div><div></div></div><figcaption> We tested the polarization of each pair of sunglasses at home.<!-- --> <span>Video: Rozette Rago</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><h2>Other good cheap sunglasses</h2></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3>Aviators</h3></div></div><div><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/39849/164079/4/117890/?merchant=Eyebuydirect">EyeBuyDirect Good Vibrations</a> sunglasses are a great choice if you’re looking for a super-classic aviator shape. Unlike our boxy <a href="#a-premium-pair-kent-wang-sunglasses-aviator">Kent Wang aviator pick</a>, our upgrade pick, the Good Vibrations frames are rounder, reminiscent of pilot’s glasses. But the Good Vibrations sunglasses cost around $25 more than the Kent Wangs, and you don’t need to spend that much for a great pair of aviators.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/39852/164082/4/117892/?merchant=Knockaround">Knockaround Mount Evans</a> pair is good, but its in-between price puts it in a strange position—it’s not as cheap as our <a href="#comfortable-sturdy-aviators-js-classic-aviator">J+S Classic Aviator</a> pick but also not a contender against the more comfortable, resilient and expensive Kent Wang aviators. These sunglasses had thinner, more wiry arms than the other aviators we tested.</p></div></div><div><div><h3>Cat-eye sunglasses</h3></div></div><div><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33093/154519/4/133299/?merchant=Eyebuydirect">EyeBuyDirect Lulu</a> sunglasses were a previous pick among cat-eye styles, and though we still like them, the gold-tone nose bridge made them a more contentious choice than the <a href="#oversize-cat-eye-sunglasses-sunski-camina">Sunski Camina</a> and <a href="#a-more-subtle-cat-eye-pair-eyebuydirect-cartel">EyeBuyDirect Cartel</a> pairs we now recommend.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33108/154536/4/95426/?merchant=ZeroUV">ZeroUV C822</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33109/154537/4/95428/?merchant=ZeroUV">ZeroUV C828</a> cat-eye sunglasses are a good buy for the price; they were pretty comfortable, and they seemed well made. Even so, the design on both was a little outlandish for most of our panel testers.</p></div></div><div><div><h3>Round sunglasses</h3></div></div><div><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/45980/173180/4/133298/?merchant=Eyebuydirect">EyeBuyDirect Taylor</a> sunglasses (without a prescription) were comfortable and cute—though their matte coloring dulled them—and they come with anti-scratch coating, which is useful. Unfortunately, they simply cannot compete with our round <a href="#higher-quality-round-frames-kent-wang-sunglasses-keyhole">Kent Wang Keyhole pick</a>, which I will have buried with me. Not only do the Keyholes have a more interesting design, but they also come with Kent Wang’s 60-day return policy and two-year warranty, in contrast to EyeBuyDirect’s 14-day return policy and one-year warranty.</p></div></div><div><div><h3>Wayfarer-style sunglasses</h3></div></div><div><div><p>It’s unfair to call the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/45981/173181/4/133300/?merchant=Kent%20Wang">Kent Wang Knox</a> a pair of Wayfarer-style sunglasses. They actually exist more as a pair of tiny sunglasses. Although they might not look like it from the product photos, they’re extremely short, and though they’re well built like other Kent Wang sunglasses, because of their shape they seem like a throwaway pair rather than a fashion statement.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/21714/161331/4/117902/?merchant=REI">Sunski Headland</a> sunglasses are a previous pick, and they look good. We still like them, and we appreciate Sunski’s mission to create less waste by choosing recycled plastic to make its sunglasses. For the price, however, the Sunski Headland pair is not as compelling a purchase as the <a href="#a-colorful-wayfarer-style-pair-blenders-sydney">Blenders Sydney</a> or the <a href="#our-favorite-prescription-sunglasses">EyeBuyDirect Nevada</a> glasses, both of which genuinely excited me to hold and wear.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><h2>The competition</h2></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3>Aviators</h3></div></div><div><div><p>Everyone who tested the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33102/154530/4/95421/?merchant=Knockaround">Knockaround Mile Highs</a> said the lenses drooped too low and made them look as if they were trying to cover bags under their eyes. Another panelist noted that the arms felt loose.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Of all the sunglasses we tested, the polarized <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/21709/118592/4/64123/?merchant=Amazon">Luenx Aviator Sunglasses</a> felt the cheapest (while actually being on the pricier side), and we worried about breaking them after just a bit of light use.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The retro <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/39851/164081/4/117891/?merchant=ZeroUV">ZeroUV 6119</a> sunglasses have huge plastic arms and thick frames reminiscent of something out of a college frat party.

Make sure the lenses offer full UV protection and polarization—look for 99% or 100% UV protection or UV400 labeling. Don’t skip this step: Dr. Ravi D. Goel, an ophthalmologist, told us that lenses without UV protection can actually allow more damaging UV rays to enter your eyes than wearing no sunglasses at all. All the sunglasses we recommend in this guide are also polarized or offer that option. Polarized lenses eliminate glare and increase contrast, and thus decrease eyestrain.</p></div></div><div><h3>What company makes the best cheap polarized sunglasses?</h3><div><p>No one brand or style will work for everyone, but after researching more than 142 affordable sunglasses from trusted retailers, we found 11 pairs of cheap polarized sunglasses. This vetted assortment should provide enough variety for most people to find sunglasses in the size and style that work with their lifestyle and face shape.</p></div></div><div><h3>How can you tell if sunglasses are of high quality?</h3><div><p>High-quality sunglasses will protect against 100% of UV light, offer polarization, and feel comfortable on the face. The frames should be lightweight and solidly constructed of metal or acetate. We especially appreciate brands that offer multiple sizes so they’ll fit more faces. Good sunglasses should also have smooth hinges that easily fold and unfold. We preferred full metal construction whenever possible.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div><div></div><div><div><a></a><h2>Meet your <!-- -->guide</h2><div><div><div><img/></div><div><p>Justin Krajeski</p><div><a href="mailto:notes@wirecutter.com"><svg><path></path></svg></a><a href="https://twitter.com/justinkrajeski"><svg><path></path></svg></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinkrajeski/"><svg><path></path></svg></a></div></div></div><div><p>Justin Krajeski is a former staff writer reporting on everyday carry at Wirecutter.

Buying Options

$19* from Amazon

*At the time of publishing, the price was $17.

Why they’re great: Of all the types of sunglasses we tested, aviators were the toughest to differentiate between because their shape is so similar. Still, our panelists all liked the J+S Classic Aviator sunglasses—during testing they were deemed universally comfortable, and they protect against UV. We’ve worn them for the past couple of years, and their metal build has proved to be well made and sturdy. They come with a one-year warranty.

We were impressed by how comfortably the J+S Classic Aviator pair fit our testers. Three Wirecutter staffers with very differently shaped heads all agreed that these aviators were the most comfortable they tried. These sunglasses are lightweight, they provide lots of coverage, and as with most of the aviators we tested, the nose pads are adjustable, so the glasses can better fit your face. The only aviators our panelists liked more than the J+S Classic Aviator pair were the Kent Wang sunglasses, and which cost nearly three times as much.

The J+S sunglasses have a sturdy metal build, and their spring hinges produce a satisfying click when you open and close the arms. These sunglasses feel well made, and we never worried about them falling apart—a good sign, especially at this price.

You can choose from a variety of colors for the J+S Classic Aviator pair, from classic to flashy, all of which complement the traditional shape. They come with a case and a cloth for cleaning the lenses, which is a nice touch for such cheap glasses. A one-year warranty covers the frame and lenses.

This style is available with 58 mm (medium) or 62 mm (large) lenses, with the latter version having an overall 152 mm frame width, the largest of any sunglasses we tested. To find the best fit, try comparing that size with another pair of sunglasses that fits you well. Look for a string of three numbers on the inside of the arm: The first number is the horizontal width of the lenses. In general, we prefer minimal company branding and logos.

Flaws but not dealbreakers: Though we haven’t encountered any issues during multiple years of long-term testing, Amazon reviews mention a wide variety of problems with the J+S Classic Aviator pair, including crookedness, breaking after a short period of time, and lenses falling out within the first couple of weeks.

Premium aviators: Kent Wang Sunglasses Aviator

A steel pair of aviators from a manufacturer we trust
You’ll pay a bit more for these aviators, but in return you get an especially comfy, notably compact pair of quality sunglasses. And they’re backed by a great two-year warranty.

Buying Options

$55 from Kent Wang

Why they’re great: Granted, the Kent Wang Sunglasses Aviator pair isn’t the cheapest out there—it costs a fair chunk more than our J+S Classic Aviator pick. Yet these sunglasses also stand out from the other aviators we tested, thanks to their smaller, more rectangular steel frames and their high quality.

Note: This style is available in 54 mm (standard) and 57 mm (large) lenses. Previously these aviators were available in just standard size.

Two staff Wirecutter staffers noted that the Kent Wang aviators had a more defined shape than other aviators, as well as a more compact frame—they’re just 130 mm in total width. But even with this smaller size, they weren’t tight around the temple or the ears. One of our testers, who is Asian, found the Kent Wang pair especially good-looking and comfortable on her low-bridge nose.

The Kent Wang pair’s steel frame feels noticeably sturdy compared with the “metallic alloy” of the cheaper J+S Classic Aviator pair—the Kent Wang sunglasses have been strong and resilient over the multiple years we’ve worn them.

Kent Wang offers three frame colors to choose from—gold, gunmetal, and silver—and the lenses on each are the same dark shade. The colors are classic but not as exciting as the wackier variety of color options available for our J+S aviators pick.

In 2021, Kent Wang increased its return-period policy to 60 days (up from 30 days) and added a two-year warranty. These improvements bumped the glasses from a good purchase to a great one. In addition, Kent Wang offers notably good customer service: We’ve even spotted Kent Wang (the person, not the brand) on social platforms like Reddit, helping customers.

The Kent Wang aviators are smaller, and more angular, than the big, rounded aviators we tested. Photo: Sarah Kobos

Flaws but not dealbreakers: The Kent Wang aviators aren’t traditional-looking aviators because of their smaller, more angular frames. If you’d prefer a bigger, more standard-looking aviator frame but with higher build quality than the J+S pair offers, we love the EyeBuyDirect Good Vibrations sunglasses, too.

Our favorite round pair: Sungait Vintage Round Sunglasses

Affordable round sunglasses with a lifetime warranty
These were the most comfortable and sturdy of the affordable round sunglasses we tested. Plus, they come with a lifetime warranty and money-back guarantee.

Buying Options

$15* from Amazon

*At the time of publishing, the price was $16.

Why they’re great: In a sea of cheap sunglasses, the Sungait Vintage Round Sunglasses are the most comfortable and the sturdiest round sunglasses we’ve found. They look good on a variety of faces, evoking the popular Ray-Ban Erika for a fraction of the cost. They also come with a lifetime warranty that even covers you if you break them, which is shockingly great for their price.

Over years of testing and wear, we still think the Sungait sunglasses fit more people better than similarly priced alternatives. They sat comfortably on our testers’ faces, thanks in part to their keyhole nose bridge, in contrast to other glasses we tried, which felt too tight or awkward.

Sturdy metal arms reinforce the Sungait’s plastic frame, which reassured our testers about the glasses’ durability. In fact, many testers noted that the metal arms felt strong and resilient. Social video manager Katie Quinn told us that she accidentally stepped on her pair, and they were completely unscathed. Sungait provides a mini screwdriver with purchase, too, in case you need to adjust the hinges; it’s a welcome surprise for a pair of sunglasses that costs less than $20.

The Sungait sunglasses look and feel classic: They’re logo-free and unisex; for a timeless combo, we recommend buying them in black with gray lenses. If you want a punchier look, over 20 color combinations are available at this writing. In addition to the mini screwdriver, the Sungaits come with a bag and a cloth for cleaning your lenses.

These have a lifetime warranty, which is a great perk for a pair of sub-$20 sunglasses.

Flaws but not dealbreakers: During testing, we had no complaints about the Sungait Vintage Round Sunglasses. Comments on Amazon, however, mention a variety of issues: The sunglasses broke within their first day of use, the lenses were too dark to see through, or their lenses began to bubble. (All would be covered by the company’s lifetime warranty.)

Only some of the Sungait variants on Amazon have polarized lenses, so double-check before you buy.

Higher-quality round frames: Kent Wang Sunglasses Keyhole

Stylish, comfortable, and highly durable
These slightly pricey sunglasses are made from cellulose acetate, which is a little more durable than standard plastic. We think they look as good as luxury pairs twice their price.

Buying Options

$55 from Kent Wang

Why they’re great: Though the Kent Wang Keyhole sunglasses are more than three times the price of the Sungait pair, they’re the most comfortable round sunglasses we tested, with a lightweight but solid build, as well as replaceable lenses. If you want to buy “nice” sunglasses but can’t spend $300, this brand offers high-quality frames for a fraction of the price of most designer sunglasses. For just over 50 bucks, the Keyhole glasses offer a distinctive, stylish look and the same UV protection as on the Sungait glasses. We’ve been recommending this pair since late 2017, and we haven’t had a single issue with them.

Whereas the Sungait round sunglasses have plastic frames with metal arms, these Kent Wang sunglasses are made from cellulose acetate, which is more lightweight and flexible than basic plastic frames. Despite being bulkier than the Sungait pair, the Kent Wang sunglasses weigh about the same. The Keyhole glasses come in various shades of vibrant acetate or horn (though the latter costs $95 more), and both versions are distinct and striking. For our testers, the glasses have garnered compliments from friends and acquaintances, as well as “Where are those from?” questions, for years. The frame has no external branding, but it does have a small, gold-foil Kent Wang logo on the inside of the left arm; the logo is tasteful and attractive, and it’s impossible to see while the sunglasses are on your face.

All of our panelists found the Kent Wang Keyhole sunglasses comfortable, and they were the ones I kept reaching for even after testing finished. One of our testers, who is Asian, found that the Keyholes were especially comfortable and good-looking on her low-bridge nose. The glasses are also solidly constructed, with flexible spring hinges that produce a satisfying click when you fold and unfold the arms. The spring hinges on the Keyhole sunglasses allow a wider range of movement in the arms than the screw-bolt hinges on the cheaper Sungait pair (or any other round sunglasses we tested, all of which weren’t as flexible). And the Keyhole pair’s lightweight acetate body made these sunglasses easy to wear for even longer periods of time, too.

I’ve been wearing them for years, and I haven’t noticed any scratches or signs of wear (though we have babied them a little due to their price).

These sunglasses don’t come with a storage pouch, but you can pay an additional $3 for a microfiber pouch or $5 for a hard case—and if you want to return them, you have an above-average 60 days. Kent Wang recently added a two-year warranty to its sunglasses, double the protection that much of the competition offers.

Flaws but not dealbreakers: The thicker acetate frame can trap sweat against your skin on hot days, which for us was annoying but never reached the stage of being uncomfortable.

Lightweight and flexible for traveling: Nooz Optics Cruz

Slim and light
These sunglasses are ultralight, ultraflat, and ultraflexible, so they’re perfect for traveling—they take up barely any room at all.

Buying Options

$70* from Amazon

$65 from Nooz

*At the time of publishing, the price was $65.

Why they’re great: The Nooz Optics Cruz sunglasses are a traveler’s dream: lightweight, flat, and flexible. They weigh just 0.4 ounce, and when folded shut, they’re just 0.4 inch thick (even in their case, they measure only 0.5 inch). They’re so flat that they’re barely noticeable in a pocket. Nooz Optics backs its sunglasses with a two-year warranty, though the policy doesn’t cover loss or normal wear and tear.

The Nooz Optics Cruz sunglasses are more expensive than some others we recommend—nearly four times as much as the Sungait Vintage Round Sunglasses—but the price isn’t absurd, and we think they’re worth it. Despite their petite frame, they don’t look cramped or undersized on the face, and they fit all of our testers well.

Though they appear logoless, they have a whisper of branding—an “N” is emblazoned on the rightmost corner of the right-eye lens, and a small “NOOZ” is embellished at the very end of the temple tips.

The Nooz Optics Cruz sunglasses are lightweight and surprisingly flexible. Photo: Sarah Kobos

The Nooz Optics Cruz sunglasses are comfortable, but not quite as comfy as our Kent Wang Keyhole pick. Their thinner arms feel a bit tighter against the temples, though they do have some give. The Nooz Optics Cruz sunglasses are made from flexible steel, and the frames feel durable and long-lasting. I never worried how they would hold up to regular use.

We tested the Nooz Optics Cruz sunglasses in tortoise and honey; they’re also available in a dozen other colors (from pink to green to black). The sunglasses come with a translucent case and a two-year warranty. You simply won’t find a better pair of thin, portable sunglasses—in a variety of colors—at this price. ThinOptics, for instance, sells sunglasses that hit the same marks as the Nooz Optics Cruz, but they cost twice as much and come in only two colorways, and their case feels bulky and antiquated compared with Nooz Optics’s transparent slide-in.

Flaws but not dealbreakers: The Nooz Optics Cruz’s steel arms were snugger than those of other frames we tested, and I could sometimes feel them slightly digging into the sides of my temples (though the effect wasn’t enough to be annoying). The tiny nose pads make it a little more difficult to find the perfect spot to rest the glasses on your nose, too. Nooz Optics doesn’t include a cleaning cloth; although it’s a small touch, we’ve come to expect a cleaning cloth alongside a good pair of sunglasses, especially at this (higher) price.

Oversize cat-eye sunglasses: Sunski Camina

Classic, large cat-eye shades
These sunglasses are comfortable to wear, and their tall, wide lenses add a dramatic flourish to the face.

Buying Options

$58 from Sunski

Why they’re great: This is the “Holly Golightly eating a croissant while looking in the window of Tiffany’s” realness we’re looking for. The Sunski Camina glasses—with their generously oversized lenses and their feline upsweep at the frame’s outer edges—evoke the look that Audrey Hepburn made popular in Breakfast at Tiffany’s. Like all of the sunglasses we tested, the Camina sunglasses offer UV protection and polarization, but they’re not as cheap as some of our favorites in other styles.

The Camina sunglasses are comfortable, with durable, robust-feeling hinges. They also offer a perk unlike anything we’ve seen from other sunglasses we recommend: Sunski uses recycled plastic, which is a nice step toward being slightly more eco-friendly.

The sunglasses measure 139 mm wide in total; each lens is approximately 53 mm. “I like how big these frames are; they cover the space above and below my eyes, so I don’t have to worry about revealing the bags under them,” my mother said with a laugh while wearing the Caminas. “They’re unusually shaped in how deep and wide they are, but I like them.”

The Caminas come with a storage pouch, a sticker, and a lens-care booklet. As with most other sunglasses we recommend, the package supplies neither a case nor a cleaning cloth. Sunski covers the frames with a 30-day return policy and a lifetime warranty, though.

If you want to buy something more eye-catching than a classic black frame, the Camina sunglasses also come in pink, translucent brown, and tortoise.

Flaws but not dealbreakers: The Sunski Camina sunglasses cost around $60, but we think the price is justified by their expansive lifetime warranty, which covers broken frames. If you encounter any manufacturer defects, or if the sunglasses break under normal use, Sunski will repair or replace them for you.

However, their lifetime warranty does not apply to scratched or damaged lenses. Lenses can be replaced through their Lens Replacement Program, for $18 per kit.

A more subtle cat-eye pair: EyeBuyDirect Cartel

Modern, restrained cat-eye shades
If you have a petite face—or you don’t want sunglasses to dominate your look—these restrained cat-eye shades are just right. Plus, they fit well and are very comfortable.

Buying Options

$22 from Eyebuydirect

Why they’re great: The comfortable EyeBuyDirect Cartel sunglasses fit all of our panelists well, and many of our testers thought the shape was a better fit for a smaller face than the Sunski Camina pair. Note that although the Cartel sunglasses provide UV protection, you have to spend around $40 more for polarization.

Most of our panelists found the Cartel pair’s plastic construction comfortable and sturdy enough for everyday wear. (And after wearing them for two years myself, I agree.) Wirecutter's Sasha VanHoven blessed these shades with the highest of compliments: “They actually look nice and they don’t feel cheap at all” compared with some of the other, similarly priced options.

“They have a pretty, classic shape, and they weren’t overwhelmingly large,” said Wirecutter staff writer Dorie Chevlen, who also noted the glasses’ good-looking tortoiseshell pattern. At this writing, EyeBuyDirect offers the Cartel frames in clear brown, tortoiseshell, and navy, but the company seems to cycle colors regularly.

Flaws but not dealbreakers: Our biggest issue with the Cartel sunglasses is the add-on fees. These would be decently priced at their base cost of $22, but polarization is an additional $40. (All prices are at the time of publication.)

EyeBuyDirect offers only a short, 14-day return policy for fit and style. But thankfully it adds a year-long warranty, which guarantees a one-time replacement pair if there are any issues with materials and workmanship.

EyeBuyDirect rotates colors on many of its sunglasses, so you have to act fast if you have your heart set on a particular shade.

Iconic Wayfarer-style sunglasses: Goodr The OGs

Timeless Wayfarer-style sunglasses
These sturdy-feeling Ray-Ban knockoffs are universally flattering. And they stay put on your face, even through an active workout routine.

Buying Options

$25 from REI

$25 from Backcountry
$25 from Goodr

Why they’re great: Goodr’s The OGs are versatile, unisex sunglasses that work on almost any face, regardless of size or shape, and they were the most universally loved Wayfarer-style sunglasses we tested. For $25, Goodr offers a solid value in a comfortable shape that feels built to last. Goodr offers only a 30-day return window, but the glasses have a year-long warranty.

Our panelists loved the OGs’ pleasant, soft matte feel, which helps the pair stay on your face even as you’re running around. Wirecutter senior editor Marguerite Preston and staff writer Dorie Chevlen both said The OGs were the most comfortable Wayfarer-style sunglasses they tried.

Some of our panelists said The OGs felt well made for their price, with sturdy, solid hinges that easily opened and closed. We had no issues with their understated design, although there is a small “goodr” logo written in white on the sides of the arms. Dorie added that the very dark look is classic and goes with just about anything. We’ve worn Goodr’s The OGs since we first made this recommendation multiple years ago, and they’ve held up well.

All of the frames Goodr sells as “The OGs” are Wayfarer-style glasses, just in different frame and lens color combinations, and all should be equally good. The OGs come in a pouch that doubles as a microfiber cleaning cloth.

If you have difficulty finding sunglasses that are big enough, Goodr sells a variant of The OGs called BFGs. Per Goodr, these glasses have “wider frames, longer arms, and bigger lenses than our OGs,” with an overall frame width of 146 mm and a temple length of 155 mm, notably longer than anything else we looked at. Although we didn’t test this version of The OGs, we still think it would be worth considering for someone who has a larger head and is looking for a Wayfarer-style pair.

Flaws but not dealbreakers: Goodr has a short return window and a dreadful naming scheme—the matte black colorway, for example, is called “A Ginger’s Soul.”

A colorful and fun Wayfarer-style pair: Blenders Sydney

Bolder Wayfarer-style sunglasses

Though these stylish sunglasses are more expensive than other Wayfarer-style glasses we like, they stand out due to their vibrant colors, interesting squarish shape, and premium look and feel.

Buying Options

$49* from Blenders

*At the time of publishing, the price was $50.

Why they’re great: As soon as I saw the Blenders Sydney sunglasses, I felt a twinge of excitement at their vibrant frames. Their honey-colored arms and light-brown polarized lenses looked optimistic. Blenders’s line of sunglasses includes seven bright frame-and-lens combinations—a deep honey, a light amber, a transparent frame with highlighter-yellow lenses—that are sure to lift spirits. (The line also offers one pair of black frames, if your spirits are fine where they are.)

These sunglasses also stand out from other Wayfarer-style pairs we’ve tested thanks to their unusually tall lenses and keyhole nose bridge, both of which look distinctive and great. Unlike our other Wayfarer-style pick, Goodr’s The OGs, these Blenders sunglasses have no aggressive branding, and their construction feels notably more luxurious than that of the cheaper Wayfarer-style pairs we’ve tried.

Beyond their striking colors, the Sydney sunglasses’s interesting design sets them apart. Their lenses and frames are more square-shaped and angular than the soft round edges of the cheaper Goodr The OGs. And unlike most other Wayfarer-style sunglasses, they have a keyhole nose bridge, which helps make them look visually lighter and less overwhelming on the face.

The Sydney’s translucent frames show off their internal structure—you can see the wires running through the arms—which is a cool touch. We also appreciate the design’s minimal branding: two, white slanted stripes on their arms that are easy to miss unless you’re looking for them.

Looks aside, these sunglasses feel high-quality, lightweight, and comfortable. They’re made of a polycarbonate frame (with triacetate cellulose lenses) that feels stronger and better constructed than the simple plastic you often see on cheap sunglasses. For example, the Sydney’s arms open and close smoothly, while those of the cheaper competition feel stiff and mechanical.

These sunglasses come with a microfiber pouch; we would’ve preferred a hard case, but it’s better than nothing.

Flaws but not dealbreakers: Although Blenders has a pretty good, 45-day return policy and a one-year warranty, that’s less protection than some of our other picks can offer.

A final note because I’m finicky: The Sydney sunglasses don’t sit perfectly flat on a table when they’re folded.

*At the time of publishing, the price was $42.

If you’re looking for a great pair of prescription sunglasses, we recommend EyeBuyDirect. In the past three years, we’ve done more than 100 hours of research in the category of prescription glasses—and tested dozens of comparable frame-and-lens pairings from 10 retailers—and we’ve found that EyeBuyDirect offers an extensive variety of high-quality frames, reliable customer assistance, and affordable prices in comparison with competitors.

In our testing for this guide, we liked the Wayfarer-style EyeBuyDirect Nevada and the round EyeBuyDirect Taylor (as well as the cat-eye Cartel pair that we recommend) because they’re comfortable, attractive, relatively inexpensive sunglasses. Adding a prescription costs around $20 in addition to the price of the frame, and polarized lenses are $40 more on top of that.

You can find tons more options on the EyeBuyDirect website, too, in all shapes and sizes. For $70 to $135 (depending on the frame and lens options), you can buy a pair of single-vision, polarized prescription sunglasses with a 14-day, no-questions-asked full refund policy and a one-year warranty. The company offers no- or low-cost two-day shipping option for a wide variety of frames.

Why you should trust us

To find out how people should be protecting their eyes, we interviewed several experts for this guide, including three ophthalmologists: Ravi D. Goel, MD, a clinical instructor at the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia and spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology; Suzann Pershing, MD, an associate professor of ophthalmology at Stanford University School of Medicine, who also serves as chief of ophthalmology for the VA Palo Alto Health Care System; and Ellen Koo, MD, an ophthalmologist and faculty member of the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute of the University of Miami who specializes in corneal and external diseases and LASIK.

About UV protection

Ultraviolet rays are short rays (or wavelengths) of light that aren’t visible to the human eye. “There are three types of UV rays: UVA, UVB, and UVC,” Pershing told us. Goel explained that although UVA rays accounted for about 95% of UV radiation, UVB rays were more likely to penetrate your eyes on an overcast day, at higher altitudes, or near highly reflective surfaces such as snow and ice. The atmosphere filters out UVC rays, so people don’t have to worry about those.

It’s important to protect against UV rays because they can cause and accelerate “many eye diseases associated with aging, including cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, and solar damage to the eye surface,” Pershing said. “You’re also at risk for eye cancer and more immediate structural damage to the retina at the back of the eye.”

Although it sounds counterintuitive, Goel told us that the level of UV radiation entering the eye in the early morning (between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.) and the late afternoon (2 p.m. to 4 p.m.) was nearly double that at midday. He also told us that UV rays generally increased between the months of April and October throughout the continental United States, although the overall level of solar radiation depends on your location.

If you want to check how strong the solar radiation is in your particular area at any given time, you can consult online resources such as AccuWeather’s UV Index Forecast. The site provides a rating for your area from 0 to 10; the higher the number, the more dangerous the sun’s UV emissions are, and the more precautions you should take to protect your eyes.

How we picked

We initially researched more than 142 lost-cost pairs of sunglasses, considering the following:

UV protection: As Ravi D. Goel, MD, told us, when you use lenses without UV protection, you end up allowing more damaging UV rays to enter your eyes than if you were wearing no sunglasses at all, and you leave your eyes vulnerable to a slew of nasty ailments (more on that in the UV protection section). When you shop for sunglasses, always make sure to choose lenses with 99% or 100% UV protection or UV400 labeling (“UV400” means that the glasses block all light rays with wavelengths shorter than 400 nanometers, which is the cutoff for UV light).
Value: After speaking to people who tended to break or lose their sunglasses, we decided that a good pair of cheap sunglasses should meet all our other criteria for less than $30. Some people are willing to take good care of their shades and pay more for style, excellent build quality, or other bonuses, so we also tested some higher-quality pairs, and for those we set our price cap at $70.
Comfort: Although comfort is hard to evaluate because people’s faces and tolerance for glasses vary widely, we sought frames that were lightweight and pleasant to wear for long periods of time on a variety of face shapes and sizes.
Build quality: Even cheap sunglasses should feel solidly constructed and be able to withstand your throwing them into a backpack or onto the backseat of a car. In our testing, we found that full-metal hinges helped—the hinges made arms easier to fold and unfold—but we considered models that had plastic hinges, too.
Design: We looked for pairs in a range of styles, to suit different tastes. Models that offered a variety of color combinations to suit more people’s preferences were great, but we didn’t eliminate glasses that lacked such options. If you’re trying to decide what frames might fit your face, check the inside arm of a pair you already like. If you see three numbers there, the first number is the horizontal width of the lens in millimeters. In general, we prefer minimal company branding and logos.
Lenses: Lens color is primarily a matter of style and preference. But as Ellen Koo, MD, told us, “Different color tints can serve different types of advantages. Gray-tinted lenses offer better overall protection and help reduce glare, especially off water and pavement surfaces. Amber or brown lenses improve contrast and enhance depth perception. Green lenses transmit all color evenly, meaning color perception is even. These also offer good contrast in dim or low-light conditions.”
Polarization: All of our picks are polarized, or have the option to add polarization, since polarized lenses eliminate glare and increase contrast, and thus decrease eyestrain. Since it’s so much nicer to look through polarized lenses, and they’re available on some sunglasses that are as cheap as non-polarized options, there’s no reason to skip this feature. You may have trouble looking at certain LCD screens through polarized lenses, however.
How we tested

In 2019, I judged 37 pairs of sunglasses over the course of a week, walking around Manhattan, reading outside coffee shops, and taking the subway. During my first round of testing, I was able to cut the list of contenders by a third, to 25 pairs. To ensure that we evaluated the fit and look of these sunglasses on a wide variety of faces, I then tested those 25 pairs with a panel of 13 people across gender and race at The New York Times building.

In 2020, I tested 22 pairs of sunglasses across four categories over a month. During walks in Brooklyn, I was able to test each pair’s comfort and design. I also tested their durability and scratch resistance by throwing them into my backpack as I headed on biweekly excursions to the grocery store and to say hi to friends. After I completed these preliminary tests, I collected opinions virtually by sharing photos and videos of myself wearing the prospective picks, as well as in person.

In 2021, I tested another seven pairs of sunglasses with the assistance of staff writer Dorie Chevlen.

The main reason polarized lenses are so much better than non-polarized versions is that they reduce glare—if you were to compare the two types of lenses side by side, you’d never go with non-polarized lenses again. We tested the polarization of the sunglasses by lining up two pairs of each model of sunglasses, turning one gradually at a 90-degree angle to the other, and seeing whether the overlapped portion of the lenses became opaque.

That test works because polarization limits the amount of light coming in horizontally while still letting light through vertically, and therefore two of the same lenses stacked at 90-degree angles should block out all light. You can view just how we did it—and how to try this test yourself with your own sunglasses—in the animation below.
